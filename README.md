### My studies repository

This repository is used for general studies. It will contain buggy/messy code and shall not be taken seriously by any means.

Some code is mine, some code is from others with GPL or Apache licenses. Check the README.md in each folder, in case you need something more specific than that.

All in all, every piece of code here is for us to learn and study.
